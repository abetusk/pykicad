libsvg.py:
  - render pin name/number properly when DEF text_offset 0
  - use DEF text_offset when rendering pin name
  - change bounding box for circles/arcs properly
  - render text after graphics.  FSQUARE3 in graphic lib is not rendering
    properly

modsvg.py:
  - bounds are a little funky, parts look shifted to the upper left.  Need to
    recenter properly

mod.py:
  - process files when units are in mm, not just deci-mils
