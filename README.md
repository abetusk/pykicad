=======


Some python scripts to help parse KiCAD files.

Still mucking around, so use at your own risk.


SVG.py is functional and has been modified to add some extra features.

lib.py and libsvg.py are mostly functional.

mod.py and modsvg.py are being worked on and are semi-functional.

net.py, sch.py, sexpression.py and the rest should be used with extreme caution.

Unless explicitely stated, all code is under GPLv3 and all other
